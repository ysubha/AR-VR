# AR-VR
1)Working with asset bundles : Used the concept to asset bundle to import 3D models at runtime.

2)VR and Bluetooth Controller : Used a bluetooth controller to walk/traverse through a Virtual environment .

3)Video on Image Target using Vuforia. : A basic example of AR where I tried playing the video every time Image Target is detected and stopped the video instead of pausing it every time it ( Image Target ) is lost. 

4)Easy_AR : Another example of AR (using EasyAR ) where I tried playing the video every time Image Target is detected. The special feature of this app is that you can create an image target at run time through your photo gallery and again choose the video you want to play on it from your gallery.

5)Arithmetic_game : created using 2D .

6)Blender Tables Video: First trial at 3D modelling using Blender , after this a also tried creating  a 3D human character using Blender (a picture of which is in the “Pictures” folder).

7)Glitch_Solar_System: Trying out Glitch.
8)Opening_LinkedIn_and_other_apps : opening many apps/links through one single Unity app.
